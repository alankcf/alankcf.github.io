			<p class = "whoami"> This is <a href = "https://github.com/alankcf/alankcf.github.io">version 1</a> of my personal webpage. This is a beginner project, made entirely from scratch!
			I'm Alan Fung, a first-year Engineering student @ <a href = "https://engineering.ubc.ca">UBC</a> in Vancouver, Canada.
			I expect to graduate in 2027. I've been studying computer science and programming since I was a sophomore at high school. Since then, I've become acquainted
			with coding in Processing, Java, HTML, and CSS. Outside computers, you'll probably catch me playing the piano, 
			skiing, and exploring the West Coast.</p>

			<p class = "whoami2"> I appreciate your time in coming here. </p>
